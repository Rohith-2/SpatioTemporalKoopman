       "{'BTC': ['China’s nationwide crackdown on crypto mining could create a competitive environment\\xa0 in which only the biggest miners can survive, said a co-founder and managing partner of Waterdrip Capital, a major investor in the Chinese crypto mining industry. “Finding suitable sites outside the mining hubs requires a lot of resources such as capital and network,” Yusan Zheng said during a Chinese-language Clubhouse discussion hosted by CoinDesk. “Only the most experienced and deep-pocketed miners will be able to carry out such a plan.”\\xa0 Local authorities in major Chinese mining hubs have started banishing crypto mining businesses since last Friday’s crackdown notice from the State Council. With little idle capacity in overseas hosting sites, some miners plan to go underground and continue to operate in other parts of the country, which might be only feasible for some of the biggest miners.

While the miners run their mining machines with hydropower in Sichuan during the rainy season in the summer, they migrate to the other two regions that chiefly have coal in the winter.\\xa0 It is likely that miners will move from these mining hubs in western China to the east, where they can put the mining machines into factories, said Zheng, who was an early investor in bitcoin mining in China. The miners could also send a few mining machines to each household in the countryside, he said.\\xa0 While the crackdown will be focused on mining hubs, it might be harder to implement if mining sites are in multiple discreet locations across the country, according to Zheng.\\xa0 Related: Market Wrap: Bitcoin, Ether Climb on &#8216;Green&#8217; Mining Plans Before Losing Steam The electricity cost will certainly rise, but the factories and individual households',\n",

The free fall in the prices of cryptocurrencies over the past week has exacerbated investor concerns around volatile technology stocks. However, market experts like Cathie Wood, who reportedly holds the largest institutional investment in cryptocurrencies through her firm, Ark Investment Management, have dismissed the recent fall in value of digital assets as a temporary setback, backing currencies like Bitcoin to touch record highs of $500,000 in the coming years.  Other big names in the finance world have also backed her point of view. Angel investor Balaji Srinivasan, who has been a longtime advocate of the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and has an uncanny knack of predicting future market direction, recently underlined his bullish view on digital assets in a media interview, mentioning` certain environmental-related and regulatory concerns around coin mining two months before Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) chief Elon Musk raised them publicly to the detriment of popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) also suspended Bitcoin payments for vehicle sales after the Musk tweet regarding the coin mining methods, sending stocks of firms that deal in crypto, like PayPal Holdings, Inc.

       "  \"On Monday, Elon Musk sent out a tweet stating he spoke with Bitcoin miners, giving investors confidence to invest in the cryptocurrency again which caused a surge in price. Myles Udland, Brian Sozzi, and Julie Hyman break down what this move may mean for the volatile cryptocurrency market. JULIE HYMAN: Once again, maybe Elon Musk driving some stuff here. It looks like he tweeted once again. This time, he's talking once again about his new sort of favorite theme about the climate and environmental implications of cryptocurrencies. He said, he has been speaking to North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current and plan renewable usage, and ask miners worldwide to do so, potentially promising. So, there is this theme developing, and there were already groups, right, that were sort of addressing this issue. At the moment though, Myles, as I mentioned, not seeing a lot of action in cryptocurrencies. We're going to talk much later-- much more later about this with the author of that note that I referenced, but you know, there is at least momentarily a little bit of a pause in the hottest of the action. MYLES UDLAND: Yeah, and of course, then Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, they've had a lot of crypto to their balance sheet. Adding to Musk's tweet saying that the meeting did, in fact, happen. And basically, miners in North America are going to coordinate. I guess you could think of it, to go back to, like, old school commodities, like an OPEC-type group where they can work together to change the mining process, such that it is greener. But I think, look, the point of the crypto cycle right now, and all crypto cycles are driven by price, is in, I mean, I don't know if it's a precarious position. I mean, personally, to me, it doesn't matter that much if the price of cryptocurrency goes up or down.

Here's a little bit about what he said about where the United States is headed regarding, perhaps, monetary policy. RAY DALIO: We know we're going to need a lot more money, a lot more debt, and this is all the cycle. You need more money, you have to print that. You need more money, so taxes go up, and that produces the dynamic. Now I can keep going on about what happens in that dynamic. It may be capital controls. You start to go to things where that money wants to go someplace, and it goes to almost anything else. Particularly at all that time, I learned in 71-- painfully learned at 71-- that it causes stocks to go up, it causes everything. We can deal with the mechanics of the stocks-- gold, Bitcoin, real estate, everything to go up because it's really going down in dollars. And that's the part of the cycle we're in.

       "  'Every bitcoin crash has many parents. In the current bloodletting (total cryptocurrency market cap is down 40% in less than two weeks), China’s recent threat of a crackdown on cryptocurrency certainly seems to be one. But feeding a crypto crash was strictly a side effect of a much broader story: a quest for total control over the financial lives of Chinese subjects. Over the past year to two years, China’s rulers have engaged in a series of moves clearly designed to clamp down, not on cryptocurrency specifically, but on open financial systems more generally. That included a brutal rebuff of Jack Ma, one of the world’s richest men, as well as the development of the digital yuan, which reportedly has strong built-in surveillance and censorship features. David Z. Morris is CoinDesk’s Chief Insights Columnist. Related: Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum&#8217;s Andrew Keys In the past, China’s crypto hesitancy has often seemed at least partly about protecting its populace from scams and theft. But in the context of this broader maneuvering for financial control, the latest round of clampdowns could be seen as a turning point as the state shifts its focus from defending its people to defending its own power. To start with the current facts: On May 18, China reiterated existing restrictions on crypto for banks and payment providers. On Friday May 22, Chinese vice premier Liu He hosted a meeting of an important financial regulatory committee. In a subsequent statement, Liu and the committee called for a crackdown on “cryptocurrency mining and trading activities” in China. The statement on mining and trading was both novel and notable for Liu’s high rank. It has had an immediate effect: Mining businesses, including HashCow and BTC.Top, had begun to wind down mining operations by Monday, according to Reuters and Al Jazeera. Scattered rumors suggest that Chinese miners are relocating to nearby sites, including Kazakhstan, and that mining equipment is showing up at local auctions in large volume.

Names including MATIC, LINK and BNB have gained 10% to 14%, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, is trading 6% higher. Altcoins suffered sharp losses last week as bitcoin crashed. Ether fell by over 40%, registering its biggest weekly decline on record.

       "  'It\\'s time to take bitcoin way more seriously as an investable asset, says Goldman Sachs.\\xa0 \"Bitcoin is now considered an investable asset. It has its own idiosyncratic risk, partly because it’s still relatively new and going through an adoption phase,\" said Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs\\' global head of digital assets, in a new piece of research. \"And it doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets. But clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable—it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset class.\" Despite Goldman\\'s rubber stamp of approval on bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies have traded anything like a typical stock of a credible company or bond in May. In truth, if bitcoin is to be considered a new asset class it has a lot in common with one area in the stock market: often very volatile penny stocks that see wild gyrations on the tiniest bit of news. Bitcoin prices continued to be under massive pressure on Sunday, plunging more than 15% by afternoon trading. At $32,652, bitcoin prices have crashed about 50% from their mid-April peak of $64,829. Ether nosedived another 18% on Sunday, bringing its drop from an all-time high this month to roughly 60%. Early Monday morning, crypto recovered slightly.

And Todd, we were just chatting earlier about inflation and the conversation around transitory impacts, the magnitude of inflation increases, really outpacing where most people have expected them to go. How are you thinking about inflation at this point as we head into a period where we do expect to see a couple of jarring prints, especially after that April number we got a couple of weeks back? TODD JABLONSKI: Well, inflation has gone from being on no one's radar screen maybe five years ago as a lead concern to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. And the tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, is enough to really cause liftoff on a variable that's been stuck at below 2% growth for some time. We actually welcome, I think, a bit of inflation coming to the US economic picture. And it's this surge that leads to print perhaps even clipping 3 and 1/2%, 4% in the shorter-term, though we do expect that to subside. We think the real question is, yes, that will inform how cyclical exposures and other asset classes perform. But where do we settle post the surge? Is it more around that 2.75% or 3%? We're going to be watching the data to see just how permanent some of these inflation forces are and how they affect the capital market outlook. - Well, whatever the case down the road, inflation is here right now. Are you guys hedging inflation at all in your positioning, Todd? TODD JABLONSKI: Yeah, as we think about the impact of inflation on multi-asset portfolios here at Principle, we're pro-inflation.
